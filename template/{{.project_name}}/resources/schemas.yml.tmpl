# Unity Catalog Schema Resources
# ============================================================================
#
# IMPORTANT: Schema resources are created if they don't exist and managed by
# the bundle. The owner is always the deployment user/service principal.
#
# Grants are configured per-target in databricks.yml to ensure:
# - User target: No SP references (works without SP configuration)
# - CI/CD targets: SP grants added via target overrides
#
# Documentation: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/bundles/resources#schema-unity-catalog
